## TLDR;
> Application developers should focus on their applications and should not be bogged down with managing UTXOs or XPubs. Developers should be able to use an open-source, easy to install solution to rapidly build full-featured Bitcoin applications.

## Disclaimer
> BUX is still considered "ALPHA" and should not be used in production until a major v1.0.0 is released.

## Stay Tuned!
Incoming awesomeness, stay tuned :)
