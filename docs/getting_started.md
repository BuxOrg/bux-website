There are two primary ways to use BUX.

- 1 Use Bux Engine in your existing Go project
- 2 Use Bux Server to start with a working instance out of the box

## Bux Engine

#### Example Code

Checkout the [official repo](https://github.com/BuxOrg/bux) for more examples on using the BUX engine.

## Bux Server

Checkout the [official repo](https://github.com/BuxOrg/bux-server) for more examples on using the BUX server.

> If you're using Bux server, you can use [Bux Console](https://github.com/BuxOrg/bux-server) to monitor and manage the server.
